export const TOOL_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = `
You have access to the following tools:
{AVAILABLE_TOOLS_LIST}

To use a tool, output a JSON object EXACTLY in this format (no other text before or after):
{
  "tool_call": {
    "name": "tool_id.action_name", // e.g., "file.readFile", "docs.search"
    "arguments": { // Arguments specific to the tool action
      "arg1": "value1",
      "arg2": "value2"
      // ...
    }
  }
}

After the tool executes, I will provide you with the result, and you can continue your task or call another tool.

When you have the final answer and don't need to use any more tools, output a JSON object EXACTLY in this format:
{
  "final_answer": "Your complete final response here."
}

Think step-by-step. Analyze the request, decide if a tool is needed, call the tool if necessary, analyze the result, and repeat until you can provide the final answer.
