## Introduction to Workflows

Workflows in Codessa are directed graphs of nodes that process information and generate responses. Each node in a workflow can be an agent, a tool, or a conditional branch. Workflows allow you to create sophisticated AI systems that can:

- Retrieve and use relevant information
- Coordinate multiple specialized agents
- Maintain memory of past interactions
- Make decisions based on context
- Generate and review code
- Research topics autonomously

## Available Workflow Types

Codessa provides several pre-built workflow templates that you can use and customize.

### Basic Workflows

#### Chat Workflow

A simple workflow with a single agent that responds to user queries.

- **Input**: User message
- **Process**: Agent generates a response
- **Output**: Agent's response

#### ReAct Workflow

A workflow that implements the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) pattern, allowing an agent to use tools to solve problems.

- **Input**: User message
- **Process**: Agent reasons about the problem, decides which tools to use, and acts by calling those tools
- **Output**: Agent's final answer after using tools

#### Multi-Agent Workflow

A workflow that coordinates multiple agents, each with different capabilities, under the supervision of a coordinator agent.

- **Input**: User message
- **Process**: Supervisor agent delegates tasks to specialist agents and integrates their responses
- **Output**: Integrated response from all agents

#### Memory-Enhanced Workflow

A workflow that enhances an agent with memory capabilities, allowing it to recall past interactions.

- **Input**: User message
- **Process**: Retrieves relevant memories, agent generates a response with context from memories, saves important information to memory
- **Output**: Agent's response informed by memories

### Advanced Workflows

#### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Workflow

A workflow that enhances the agent with document retrieval capabilities, providing relevant context for generating responses.

- **Input**: User query
- **Process**: Retrieves relevant documents, formats them as context, agent generates a response using the context
- **Output**: Agent's response informed by retrieved documents

#### Collaborative Workflow

A workflow that coordinates multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks, with each agent having a specific role and expertise.

- **Input**: User task
- **Process**: Analyzes the task, delegates to appropriate specialist agents, integrates their responses
- **Output**: Comprehensive solution integrating specialist insights

#### Memory-Enhanced Agent Workflow

An advanced workflow with sophisticated memory capabilities, allowing the agent to recall past interactions, learn from them, and maintain context over long conversations.

- **Input**: User message
- **Process**: Retrieves relevant memories, enhances context with memories, agent generates a personalized response, saves important information to memory
- **Output**: Personalized response informed by long-term memory

#### Code Generation Workflow

A specialized workflow for generating and reviewing code, using separate agents for code generation and code review.

- **Input**: Code requirements
- **Process**: Analyzes requirements, generates code, reviews code for quality and correctness, refines code based on review
- **Output**: High-quality, reviewed code

#### Research Workflow

An autonomous research agent workflow that can research a topic, gather information from multiple sources, analyze it, and synthesize findings.

- **Input**: Research topic
- **Process**: Analyzes topic into subtopics, gathers information on each subtopic, analyzes information, synthesizes findings
- **Output**: Comprehensive research report

## Creating Workflows

To create a workflow:

1. Open the Workflow Manager by clicking on the "Workflows" button in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Workflow" or "Create LangGraph Workflow"
3. Select a workflow type
4. Enter a name and description for the workflow
5. Select an agent to use in the workflow
6. Depending on the workflow type, you may need to select additional agents, tools, or provide other information
7. Click "Create" to create the workflow

## Running Workflows

To run a workflow:

1. Open the Workflow Manager
2. Find the workflow you want to run
3. Click the "Run" button next to the workflow
4. Enter input for the workflow
5. The workflow will execute and display the result

## Customizing Workflows

Workflows can be customized in several ways:

1. **Changing Agents**: You can select different agents for different roles in the workflow
2. **Adding Tools**: For workflows that use tools, you can select which tools to include
3. **Adjusting Parameters**: Some workflows have parameters that can be adjusted, such as memory retrieval settings
4. **Editing Workflow Structure**: Advanced users can modify the workflow structure by editing the workflow definition

## Memory Integration

Codessa workflows integrate with the memory system to provide long-term recall and context. The memory system uses vector embeddings to store and retrieve information based on semantic similarity.

Memory-enhanced workflows can:

- Retrieve relevant memories based on the current conversation
- Save important information from conversations to memory
- Use memories to provide more personalized and contextually relevant responses
- Maintain context over long conversations

## Technical Details

Codessa workflows are implemented using:

- **LangGraph**: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **LangMem**: A memory system for storing and retrieving information

The workflow system uses a directed graph architecture where:

- **Nodes** represent processing steps (agents, tools, conditionals)
- **Edges** represent the flow of information between nodes
- **State** is passed between nodes and contains the current context and results

Each workflow is defined by:

- A set of nodes with their configuration
- A set of edges connecting the nodes
- A starting node
- Optional metadata (name, description, version)

For more advanced customization, you can create your own workflow templates by extending the existing ones or creating new ones from scratch.
